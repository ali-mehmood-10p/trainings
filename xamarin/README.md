## Introduction
Build native apps for multiple platforms on a shared C# codebase. Use the same IDE, language, and APIs everywhere.
    -  Native UI, native API access, and native performance
    -  Anything you can do in Objective-C, Swift, or Java you can do in C# with Xamarin
    -  Ship cutting-edge apps with same-day support for new OS releases

## Installation Guide
Overview of installation and setup practices that apply across platforms.
  -  **[Windows][xamarinWin]** users 
  -  **[Mac]** users can use **[Xamarin Studio][xamarinStudioMac]** or can download and setup **[Visual Studio] [xamarinVisualStudioMac]** for mac

Some poiters as you're performing installation:
    -  Now that Visual Studio for Mac is officially released, seems the direction is to move to VS and leave XS behind. After installing VS for Mac.
    -  Xamarin Studio will stop receiving updates in coming days to months hence everybody should move to Visual Studio for Mac.
